# Matplotlib-challange

I have recently joined Pymaceuticals Inc., a pharmaceutical company based out of San Diego. As a senior data analyst, I have received access to the data of their most recent animal study. In the study, 249 mice had developed tumors and were treated with several drugs. Within the last 45 days, the mice tumors have been observed and measured. The study was completed to show the performance of Pymaceuticals' drugs such as Capomulin. I have been tasked by the executive team to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. I will be using Matplotlib and Pandas to create tables needed to represent this data. 

The Data Analysis Includes:
- Observations and Insights
- Summary Statistics
- Bar and Pie Charts
- Quartiles, Outliers, and Boxplots
- Line and Scatter Plots
- Correlation and Regression
